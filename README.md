Traffic sign detection and recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks

To run the modules train and run the GTSRB Dataset must be downloaded to the same location as the python files and the images must be saved in the following hierarchy:
 - GTSRB (Hauptordner)
    - Final_Training
    - Final_Test
    - GT-final_test.csv


The Dataset can be found here:https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html
